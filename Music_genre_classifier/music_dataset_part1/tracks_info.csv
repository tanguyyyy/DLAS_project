I've got another confession to make, I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break, holdin' you
Were you born to resist or be abused?

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

Are you gone and on to someone new?
I needed somewhere to hang my head without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have, but had no use
I was too weak to give in, too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again, but I break loose
My head is giving me life or death, but I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in, I refuse

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Oh, oh oh, oh oh

Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
The life, the love you'd die to heal
The hope that starts the broken hearts
You trust, you must confess

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

I've got another confession, my friend, I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again somewhere new
Were you born to resist or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in, I refuse

Is someone getting the best

They're gonna clean up your looks
With all the lies in the books
To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work
They're gonna give you a smirk
'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip up your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
Another cog in the murder machine

They said ""All teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed""
So, darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me

The boys and girls in the clique
The awful names that they stick
You're never gonna fit in much, kid
But if you're troubled and hurt
What you got under your shirt
Will make them pay for the things that they did

They said ""All teenagers scare the living shit out of me

So, darken your clothes or strike a violent pose

Hit that, hit that snare

I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

Second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore you're nothing more
I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well, there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like
It's easy if you do it right
Well I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him right now
And if you could, then you know you would
'Cause God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

I watched his wildest dreams come true
And not one of them involving you
Just watch my wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now

In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come and wash away

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

For what I've done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving what I've done

Erase myself

On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there, like a stone
I'll wait for you there, alone

And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there, like a stone
I'll wait for you there, alone, alone

And on I read, until the day was gone
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed, and all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death, I will wander on

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently

Yeah
Here we go

It's a new day but it all feels old
""It's a good life"" – that's what I'm told
But every day, it all just feels the same
At my high school it felt more to me
Like a jail cell, a penitentiary
My time spent there – it only made me see
That I don't ever wanna be like you
I don't wanna do the things you do
I'm never gonna to hear the words you say and...

I don't ever wanna– I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

""Go to college or university
Get a real job"" – that's what they said to me
But I could never live the way they want
I'm going to get by And just do my time
Outta step while they all get in line
I'm just a minor threat so pay no mind
Do you really wanna to be like them?
Do you really wanna be another trend?
Do you wanna be part of that crowd? 'Cause...

I don't ever wanna– I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

Shake it once, that's fine
Shake it twice, that's okay
Shake it three times
You're playing with your self again
(You, don't wanna be just like you)
What I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
Now you can feel me, sing if you're with me
You, don't wanna be just like you

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known

Oh, oh oh, oh oh

Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
The life, the love you'd die to heal
The hope that starts the broken hearts
You trust, you must confess

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

I've got another confession, my friend, I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again somewhere new
Were you born to resist or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in, I refuse

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best

Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunkt, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End
Knocked out, but boy, you better come to
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burnin' so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
White heat is screamin' in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation
This chapter's gonna be a close one
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one
All on a spaceship, persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Wait a minute, I'm passin' out win or lose, just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew, how about you?
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new, just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew, right on cue

Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation

Don't die, you know, the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burnin' so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering
Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades
Can't stop the spirits when they need you

Poppa was a copper and her momma was a hippie
In Alabama she would swing a hammer

Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you!

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

And the message coming from my eyes
Says ""Leave it alone""


Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell
And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do

And the feeling coming from my bones
Says ""Find a home""



I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will think no more

And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me ""Go back home""

Well, if you wanted honesty
That's all you had to say
I never want to let you down
Or have you go, it's better off this way
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot
From jumping out the second floor?

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

What will it take to show you
That it's not the life it seems? (I'm not okay)
I've told you time and time again
You sing the words but don't know what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook
For the last time, take a good hard look

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages all are torn and frayed
I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay now (I'm okay, now)
But you really need to listen to me
Because I'm telling you the truth
I mean this, I'm okay! (Trust me)

Drowning deep in my sea of loathing
Broken, your servant, I kneel (Will you give in to me?)
It seems what's left of my human side
Is slowly changing in me (Will you give in to me?)
Looking at my own reflection
When suddenly it changes, violently it changes
Oh no, there is no turning back now
You've woken up the demon in me

Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness

Madness is the gift that has been given to me

I can see inside you, the sickness is rising
Don't try to deny what you feel (Will you give in to me?)
It seems that all that was good has died
And is decaying in me (Will you give in to me?)
It seems you're having some trouble
In dealing with these changes, living with these changes
Oh no, the world is a scary place
Now that you've woken up the demon in me

Get up, come on, get down with the sickness

Get up, come on, get down with the sickness
Open up your hate and let it flow into me
Get up, come on, get down with the sickness

Don't do it again, I'll be a good boy!

Why did you have to hit me like that, mommy?
Don't do it, you're hurting me!

When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""
He said, ""Will you defeat them?
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?""
""Because one day, I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade""
When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
To see a marching band
He said, ""Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?""

Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on, we carry through the fears
Oh, oh, oh
Disappointed faces of your peers
Oh, oh, oh
Take a look at me, 'cause I could not care at all
Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy, who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care

We'll carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me
Your memory will carry on
We'll carry on

It starts with one
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal
You didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, they didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory
Of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually
Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
Oh, God, it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

How do you feel? That is the question
But I forget you don't expect an easy answer
When something like a soul becomes initialized and folded up
Like paper dolls and little notes, you can’t expect a bit of hope

So while you’re outside looking in, describing what you see
Remember what you’re staring at is me

‘Cause I’m looking at you through the glass
Don’t know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

How much is real? So much to question
An epidemic of the mannequins, contaminating everything
We thought came from the heart, but never did right from the start
Just listen to the noises, null and void instead of voices

Before you tell yourself, it's just a different scene
Remember it's just different from what you've seen

I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head
'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you
That forever feels like home, sitting all alone inside your head

And it's the stars, the stars
That shine for you
And it's the stars, the stars
That lie to you, yeah-ah

I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
Oh, God, it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you

'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever, but no one ever tells you

I got your picture
I'm coming with you
Dear Maria, count me in
There's a story at the bottom of this bottle
And I'm the pen

When the lights go up
I want to watch the way you take the stage by storm
The way you wrap those boys around your finger
Go on and play the leader
'Cause you know it's what you're good at
The low road for the fast track
Make every second last

'Cause I got your picture
I'm coming with you
Dear Maria, count me in
There's a story at the bottom of this bottle
And I'm the pen
Make it count when I'm the one who's selling you out
'Cause it feels like stealing hearts
Calling your name from the crowd

Doesn’t that mean
You'll be the showgirl of the home-team
I'll be the narrator
Telling another tale of the American dream
I see your name in lights
We can make you a star
Girl, we'll take the world by storm
It isn't that hard

'Cause I got your picture
I'm coming with you
Dear Maria, count me in
There's a story at the bottom of this bottle
And I'm the pen
Make it count when I'm the one who's selling you out
'Cause it feels like stealing hearts
Calling your name from the crowd

Take a breath
Don't it sound so easy?
Never had a doubt
Now I'm going crazy
Watching from the floor
Take a breath
And let the rest come easy
Never settle down
'Cause the cash flow leaves me
Always wanting more

'Cause I got your picture
I'm coming with you
Dear Maria, count me in
There's a story at the bottom of this bottle
And I'm the pen
Make it count when I'm the one who's selling you out

I only lie when I love you
I only crawl when I hit the ground
You only cry when I love you
I only lie when I make a sound

Go ahead, muck about
I got my conscience twisted
Pull your hair, make me shout
It's just that you insisted I was good for nothing
Like you were onto something

I only lie when I love you
I only crawl when I hit the ground
You only cry when I love you
I only lie when I make a sound

Go ahead, pull the plug
Broken finger, sticky trigger
Now I can't get it off my chest
And now I'm wishing you were someone else
You know I'm up to something
Diagnosed, no disease
Got a suspicion but you just can't find it up your sleeve
And now I beg the truth be told from someone else
All of that fuss for nothing

In my defence all my intentions were good
And heaven holds a place somewhere for the misunderstood
You know I'd give you blood if it'd be enough
Devils on my doorstep since the day I was born
It's hard to find a sunset in the eye of a storm
But I'm a dreamer by design and I know in time we'll put this behind

For what it's worth I'm sorry for the hurt
I'll be the first to say, ""I made my own mistakes""
For what it's worth I know it's just a word and words betray
Sometimes we lose our way
For what it's worth

Behind the lens is a poison picture you paint
And lets not pretend you were ever searching for saints
'Cause I've been crucified for just being alive
Somewhere in the crossfire of this whispering war
Seems that I've forgot just what I was fighting for
But underneath my skin there's a fire within
Still burning

For what it's worth I'm sorry for the hurt
I'll be the first to say, ""I made my own mistakes""
For what it's worth I know it's just a word and words betray
Sometimes we lose our way
For what it's worth

The first bird to fly gets all the arrows
Let's leave the past behind with all our sorrows
I'll build a bridge between us and I'll swallow my pride

For what it's worth I'm sorry for the hurt
I'll be the first to say, ""I made my own mistakes""
For what it's worth I know it's just a word and words betray
Sometimes we lose our way

You might kill me with desire
Wind me tighter than a wire
It's something that you do to me
I run away like mercury
And I know you think it's rough
When you're tryna patch us up
And I say, ""Honey, what is love?""
You just say I drink too much

Maybe I'm defective
Or maybe I'm dumb
I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done
Maybe I'm bad natured
Or maybe I'm young
I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done

And on the t-shirt that I wear
Pick the thorns out of my hair
I broke your heart so carelessly
But made the pieces part of me
And now it hurts what we've become
'Cause you taught me how to love
It's me who taught you how to stop
And you just say I drink too much

You took all these parts but you couldn't make it
Apathetic and senile, that's just how you run
It's hard to be on the move when your ego weighs a ton

We got places to be and we got bodies to move.""

It's a masquerade for a bitter truth
This ain't a truce from me to you
It's a consequence for a bitter you

These days, they seem so
Close and yet so far away
It's a small price to have to pay
For you
I'm so engrossed in every word she says
It's like I'm just thinking
We're up and down
But still she's laughing in the rain

There's a way to reach the sunlight in my mind
And I'll take you there for nothing
Felicity, your smile
Does it make you feel better that it holds me together?

She's my elixir
She's the cure of cures
To see that face in another place
Makes me just want more

Someday the pain I feel in my heart
Will slowly start to fade
'Till I feel nothing at all
And all trace of who I was will be lost
’Cos dreams are only made to destroy things like us
Each time I close my eyes
I see your spirit rise
But the more it comes to life
I disappear
I see your ghost in the middle of the night
I talk to shadows that you left behind
You dug me a hole
You hung me a noose
Someday I'll be someone that you never knew
I've already lost
Everything I could lose
And I can’t make it stop
If I'm nothing to you
As dawn breaks I remain in the dark
Your echo leaves a scar so you'll never be gone
But someday all my love will be numb
And I'll grow tired of waiting for the feeling to come
Each time I close my eyes
I see your spirit rise
But the more it comes to life
I disappear

It's been a day
It's felt like an age
Since I have seen you
A face to face so we can say what we need to
I know you've changed
You don't look the same
We all make mistakes
It's growing pains, it's just a phase we have to go through

I've been wasting all this time
Trying to keep you off my mind
Yeah, you off my mind, no more
I've been wasting all these nights
Trying to keep you off my mind
Yeah, you off my mind, no more

How long should I wait (I wait, I wait)
To feel myself, feel myself again
Cause I don’t think you hate (You hate, you hate)
When we’re side by side but going two separate ways

I've been wasting all this time
Trying to keep you off my mind
Yeah, you off my mind, no more
I've been wasting all these nights

These days we stand confused just like a flock of sheep
Who've come to know their shepherds, getting harder to see
If there's no God to watch over us all
Don't wait on Jesus to save your broken soul
Got me singing now

Woah, we're trapped between two walls
Woah, we gotta get out, we're breaking them down singing
Oooo, the cracks begin to form
Woah

So won't you raise your voice stand up and stamp your feet
We'll march together 'til dawn in our new masterpiece
If there's no God to watch over us all
Don't wait on Jesus to save your broken soul
Got me singing now

Woah, we're trapped between two walls
Woah, we gotta get out,  breaking them down singing
Ohh, the cracks begin to form
Woah

Welcome one and you all to the way it always should be
To the world where you are the master of your destiny
Got me talking like
There is no God coming to save us all
Stop waiting for Jesus to save your soul
It's up to us now

Woah, we're trapped between two walls
Woah, we gotta get out,we're breaking them down singing
Oooo, the cracks begin to form
Woah

I'm so pathetic for ever thinking I'd change
When there are pieces of my past that I conveniently erased
I fell in over my head, you wouldn't understand
And now my brain is just a tired mess
Of all the things I've abandoned

And you should know
You never were an exception
I think I shut you out as a form of protection
Now there's an empty space
That's growing in my head and in my home
Starting to show, I thought you should know

You can fall to your knees and pray
'Cause I'm a sinner now
And I won't be saved
I've been lying to you more each day
'Cause I'm a sinner now
In all my sins I've found
They won't wash away

I let you down, it's what I always do best
I found my way under your skin and somehow crept into your chest
There's all the hours I wasted trying hard to fool you
Well, they were never enough
Never enough to hide all the pain I put you through
(Wash away your sins)

You can fall to your knees and pray
'Cause I'm a sinner now
And I won't be saved
I've been lying to you more each day
'Cause I'm a sinner now
In all my sins I've found
They won't wash away

I should be living a life and not trying to fight it
Instead of giving it up I'm just trying to hide it

Well it just got late real fast
You're way past all the things that I'm doing wrong
I'll take you home to your mother
And I could do without all this
But I want it
I better stick around a little while
I wanna be your lover

And I'll keep coming around just to see your face

And I'll wait, I'll stay
When I'm giving all my time for you
You know, I get nothing else but silence

You hole punched right through me
Like you knew it
But now you're flat out on the ground
Say it's now or never
So let's just get simple
And we'll talk about all the little things that piss you off
And say hello to your brother

I'll keep knocking around just to see your face

And I'll wait, I'll stay
When I'm giving all my time for you
You know, I get nothing else but silence
And I'll wait, I'll stay
While my cigarette intoxicates
You know, I get nothing else but silence

So lay your makeup 
'Cause me staying is only love lost

And I'll wait, I'll stay
When I'm giving all my time for you
You know I get nothing else but silence

And I'll wait, I'll stay
While my cigarette intoxicates
You know, I get nothing else but silence
And I'll keep coming around just to see your face

Packing up your things again, and I thought we were past this
I don't need reminding of something I can't forget
I'm real sorry to my mother, 'cause I know how much you loved her
This could've been so different, it's just too hard to move on from yet

And I'd give up everything for a moment of your time
And I'd give up everything

No one ever took my eyes off you, girl
And I wish that you could stay
I guess I'm always waiting for you
To come back and call my name
Like we both still felt the same
I'm miserable, and I don't want you to know

I've still got your picture in my wallet
I want you to know I've still got it
I can't seem to take it out as much as I want to lose it now
I miss hearing you talk in your sleep
The sight of blood, it makes you weak
And the way you look at me over your phone
And your scent all through my home

And I'd give up everything for a moment of your time
And I'd give up everything

No one ever took my eyes off you, girl
And I wish that you could stay
I guess I'm always waiting for you
To come back and call my name
Like we both still felt the same
I'm miserable, and I don't want you to know

I close my eyes, you're all I see
You're all I hear, you're all I need
And you don't leave like the smoke in my lungs
I can't sleep
I close my eyes, you're all I see
You're all I hear, you're all I need
And you don't leave like the smoke in my lungs

I like being with you
When we hang out in my bedroom and order in too much food
I like sleeping with you
When we're hiding under-covers making the most of our youth

But I hate that I'll never really know if you're telling the truth
It drives me wild trusting you're talking to who you say you do
Ten shots of anxiety hurl through my veins
You've left me questioning everything, and I feel that I'm to blame

I like driving with you
When we sing with silly voices switching lanes and cutting loose
I like laughing with you
When you show up at my front door like we've got nothing to lose

But I hate that I'll never really know if you're telling the truth
It drives me wild trusting you're talking to who you say you do

Is that what you're worth?
Or a shot in the dark
From the corner of the past
You wondered why I lied to you
The night you came into my room
One will settle the nerves
Or take the edge off
I've only got so many left to lose
I'll pick and choose

My bark is your bite
It cuts like a knife when I lie because
My mind says it's the best thing to do
For you
My mind says it's the best thing to do
For you
My mind says it's the best thing to do

Is it a sickness to
Doubt the price of the thoughts
In the corner of your skull?
And you wondered why I took my time
To throw my arms around you
Nobody wants to love
To carry the burden
Or balance the glass
With each and every move
I'll pick and choose

My bark is your bite
But time after time I lie because
My mind says it's the best thing to do
For you
My mind says it's the best thing to do
For you
My mind says it's the best thing to do

My bark is your bite
It's like I'm alive
When I lie because
My mind says it's the best thing to do
So I'll take one more chance
I'll dance if you'll dance
I'll try because
My mind says it's the best thing to do
My mind says it's the best thing to do
For you
My mind says it's the best thing to do

Get busy there's a timeline

I'll wait for you at the back of the queue

These red tides of sand form the sea
Confessed to a man, he's not quite a man so to speak
Electric fire filled with my desire

Breathing upwards towards rhe eyes in the trees
Soft winds blow
Through these fields
Desert domes
These strange things

Can you hear the engines turning? Life will never tire
Clocks stopped time
Warm light glows

Moonlight slows

And if you love me then why won't you use me?
If you hate me then why do you care?
You said that we would go the distance
Now you don't take me anywhere
I bite my tongue, but fuck your heart
I can't stand, I can't stand you, baby

We don't know which way to go
We don't know which way's home
We don't know which way to go
We don't know which way's home

And we blew up like a bonfire, fire, fire
And we blew up like a bonfire, fire, fire

And you say you want to be alone
Outside the place that we call home
When you come at me with that face
I don't know what to say

Cause our love is going up in flames

So let's burn this to ashes
And go our own way
So pass me the matches
And we'll both watch the flames

Choose love, choose tears
Choose burning everything that you are near
Choose hate, choose hypocrites who whisper in your ear
Choose faith, choose a loaded gun inside your pillowcase
Choose sex, choose something just for choosing something’s sake

Well maybe you deserve better
(Maybe you deserve better)
Cause the blues are forever
For the sons and the daughters, mothers and fathers
It keeps getting harder, keeps getting harder to live

Choose friends, choose scum
Choose to stick around for all the years to come
Choose wealth, choose all the awful things that you have done
Choose death, regret everything you wish that you had said
Choose trust, choose clinging on just because you must

Well maybe you deserve better
(Maybe you deserve better)
Cause the blues are forever
For the sons and the daughters, mothers and fathers
It keeps getting harder, keeps getting harder to live

Get yours, I got mine
No second chances, don’t you act surprised
This time, I’m bullet proof you won’t take me alive

Well maybe you deserve better

All I hear are whispers
All I hear are whispers
The freedom committee
First annual meeting of souls
There's lots of discussion
No action from those who chose
A lifetime of hate the better ones speak the most
Your last breath was left
Among the rapturous roar
All I hear are whispers
This is all we've ever know
Everything we've ever owned
Washed up with memories
Can life get sold
If you think dying is the easy part
Leaving life behind is the thing that's hard
(All I hear are whispers)
Dying was the easy part
There's nothing left in the end so journey far
(All I hear are whispers)
The under the earth
Or burning ashes the most
Just shoot me through space
I'll tell you how far it goes
A lifetime of dust
We're made of water of course
And when that evaporates is that where our souls goes
(All I hear are whispers)
This is all we've ever know
Everything we've ever owned
Washed up with memories
Can life get sold
If you think dying is the easy part
Leaving life behind is the thing that's hard
(All I hear are whispers)
Dying was the easy part
There's nothing left in the end so journey far
I'm a stronger man than I've ever been before
I put family in the ground this year
And I stand and watch their souls
Climbing high up out their bodies
And wondering where to go
Who said dying was the easy part
If you think dying is the part
Leaving life behind is the thing that's hard
(All I hear are whispers)
Dying was the easy part
There's nothing left in the end so journey far
All I hear are whispers
All I hear are whispers
All I hear are whispers
There's nothing left in the end so journey far

Back and forth, I've been here before
The words you said just left me on the floor
And I came 'round and blew smoke from my mouth
I thought I saw you in the clouds
But I chose to forgive, I find it hard to forget
Even though you said it's something you'd regret

It's in the back of my mind
But it's worse when I sleep
Now I'm losing my breath
And I'll never understand how you could forget me

This feeling will only get better
I'll just hold it all together
'Cause we are good for each other
And this will pass like the weather

Maybe we both know it doesn't work
I don't know what to do without making it worse
But I don't like who I am when I'm not with you
I couldn't make sense of it, I hadn't slept for days
I never had the feeling that could make me throw up in the street

It's in the back of my mind
But it's worse when I sleep
Now I'm losing my breath
And I'll never understand how you could forget me

This feeling will only get better
I'll just hold it all together

I've been down too long
Dragging this out
And put it all down to shame
I've been smothered in doubt
And I've only got myself to blame
Spent a year unsure
What I started this for
'Cause I thought it was to get away
And I question myself every other fucking day
Cause I've been trying
To find a way to begin
Cause I know you been
Yeah I know you've been dying
To get under my skin
I was sure if I let it all out
And put myself on the page
I could get in your head
And start to make room for change
But now I see that it's really just me
That cares what I've got to say
And I question myself every other fucking day
Cause I've been trying
To find a way to begin
Cause I know you been
Yeah I know you've been dying
To get under my skin yeah
Wishing for someone else's life
Instead of living mine
I need a little time

In my defence all my intentions were good
And heaven holds a place somewhere for the misunderstood
You know I'd give you blood if it'd be enough
Devils on my doorstep since the day I was born
It's hard to find a sunset in the eye of a storm
But I'm a dreamer by design and I know in time we'll put this behind

For what it's worth I'm sorry for the hurt
I'll be the first to say, ""I made my own mistakes""
For what it's worth I know it's just a word and words betray
Sometimes we lose our way
For what it's worth

Behind the lens is a poison picture you paint
And lets not pretend you were ever searching for saints
'Cause I've been crucified for just being alive
Somewhere in the crossfire of this whispering war
Seems that I've forgot just what I was fighting for
But underneath my skin there's a fire within
Still burning

For what it's worth I'm sorry for the hurt
I'll be the first to say, ""I made my own mistakes""
For what it's worth I know it's just a word and words betray
Sometimes we lose our way
For what it's worth

The first bird to fly gets all the arrows
Let's leave the past behind with all our sorrows
I'll build a bridge between us and I'll swallow my pride

For what it's worth I'm sorry for the hurt
I'll be the first to say, ""I made my own mistakes""
For what it's worth I know it's just a word and words betray
Sometimes we lose our way
For what it's worth

Mate
I'm stuck outside
Looks like the sun is rising soon
And the night didn't go like I said it would
Mate
I can see your light
And I know that you're up entertaining
This isn't the neighbours complaining
The buses have stopped and it's raining

I just need to sleep
To forget about her
Forget what I said
Please throw down your keys
And I won't interfere
Go straight into bed

I'm out here in the rain
And life is throwing stones at me
It's going down the drain
It's all become too much for me
Oh can you help me mate
Oh can you help me mate

Mate
I know you're home
And I know that your there with somebody
If I'm talking too much then just stop me
I'll get out of your way in a hurry

I just so feel so tired
Can't forget about her
Can't forget

I'm out here in the rain
And life is throwing stones at me
It's going down the drain
It's all become too much for me
Oh can you help me mate
It's all become too much
Oh can you help me mate

It's really getting late
I'm out here in a state
Oh I thought you were my mate

I'm out here in the rain
And life is throwing stones at me
It's going down the drain
It's all become too much for me
Oh can you help me mate

And life is throwing stones at me

I'm stranded alone in the desert
These red tides of sand form the sea
Confessed to a man, he's not quite a man so to speak
Electric fire filled with my desire
Can you hear the engines turning? Life will never tire
Breathing upwards towards rhe eyes in the trees
Soft winds blow
Through these fields
Desert domes
These strange things
Electric fire filled with my desire
Can you hear the engines turning? Life will never tire
Clocks stopped time
Warm light glows
Wishful sleep
Moonlight slows
For the people forcing us to stay and the prophets
Lead us on our way (They will not be told)
Through the ages leading us astray (They will not be told)
But the people, nothing more to say

Cause if I make this world mine
I want you by my side
No matter what will be
I'd do it all for you and me

But waiting on nothing don't get you far

Here we go again my lover
Here we go again
I couldn't get you out my eyesight
And I can't be alone again so save me

I like the feeling you give me baby
I like the way that you taste woah
I like the feeling you give me baby
I'm Bending love until it breaks

I feel that sugar burning deep inside my lungs
And all we need is just one night to fall in love
I can feel that fire burning over us
I feel that sugar burning deep inside my lungs, inside my lungs

I've had a lot of hard times baby
But I've got time to waste
When everything I do seems crazy
I'm running just to keep the pace and I'd say

I like the feeling you give me baby
I like the way that you taste woah
I like the feeling you give me baby
I'm tired of trying to play it safe

I feel that sugar burning deep inside my lungs
And all we need is just one night to fall in love
I can feel that fire burning over us
I feel that sugar burning deep inside my lungs, inside my lungs

So can you pick me up again?
Fix the blues inside my head?
I can't walk alone on the city streets to try and find myself again
Cause I can show you what's inside
Lay bare these marks of mine
And lose ourselves for a lonely hour and disappear into the night
I feel that sugar burning deep inside my lungs
And all we need is just one night to fall in love

I feel that sugar burning deep inside my lungs
And all we need is just one night to fall in love
I can feel that fire burning over us
I feel that sugar burning deep inside my lungs, inside my lungs

I wish that you would hear me cry in the darkness
And turn it into a call for action
I'm searchin' for a melody that will make you see
All the pain you've put me through

And I know in a minute
I'll be the lonely one
And I'm so good at forgivin'
I'll do it time after time after time

Love is just a lie
Love is just a lie
(Love is just a)
Love is just a lie, lie, lie
(Love is just a)

Help me to remember why I'm designing
Your picture perfect hallucination
Now I'm diggin' for a memory
That could remedy all the ways that I love you

And I know in a minute
I'll be the lonely one
And I'm so good at forgivin'
I'll do it time after time after time

Why fall in love when you can always fall asleep
Why follow your heart when you can't follow your dreams
Love in all these movies girl, it's never what it seems
But oh I miss that feelin' baby, make me believe
Love is just a lie but baby I might try
I can write a lullaby and make your heart come back to life
Revive this feelin', your wounds are healin'
Show me how to love you like there is no fucking ceiling

And I know in a minute (love is just a lie, love is just a lie)
I'll be the lonely one (love is just a lie, love is just a lie)
And I'm so good at forgivin'
I'll do it time after time after time

Love is just a lie, lie, lie
(Love is just a lie, lie, lie)
Love is just a lie, lie, lie

There is something you should know
I can't sing a love song anymore
There's something going on
And I can't turn my back on it anymore

How can we go to sleep at night
And lay there in our beds?
When we know what's going on
With the world today

Is it in my head?
Am I the only one?
Is it in my head?
When the war has just began
We look away, look away, look away, look away
Look away, look away, look away, look away
Is it in my head?
Is it in my head?
Look away, look away, no

There's something in the air at night
That feels so different
And I don't understand
I didn't see this one coming

Oh, God, I'm terrified when I’m not with you
No matter how I tried, I was feeling blue

You walked into my life, showed me something new
Oh, baby, when you're gone I don't know what I should do

’Cause only you can make me fly like I'm Superman
How you make feel like this, hard to understand
When I need a hero, you'll be my hero
When I feel the darkness, you'll be the light
'Cause only you can make me fly like I'm Superman
Like a Superman

When all my hope is gone and I'm caving in
When I can see the light from the dark within

You walked into my life, showed me something new
Oh, baby, when you're gone I don’t know what I should do

’Cause only you can make me fly like I'm Superman
How you make feel like this, hard to understand
When I need a hero, you’ll be my hero
When I feel the darkness, you'll be the light
'Cause only you can make me fly like I'm Superman
Like a Superman

When you’re around I can reach for the sky
I won't look down, going high at night
When you're around I'm above all the clouds
You don't let me down

'Cause only you can make me fly like I'm Superman
How you make feel like this, hard to understand
When I need a hero, you'll be my hero
When I feel the darkness, you'll be the light
'Cause only you can make me fly like I'm Superman

The more I go, the less it seems to make sense
Not sleeping in my bed, can really feel the distance
How can we fix what has already been stolen?
The emptiness inside is eating us alive
I don't want to waste our precious time

’Cause we're not getting any younger now
We're not getting any closer to the truth
And there’s nothing left to figure out
So, woa-oa-oah

So why don't you release me
Release me
Release me
I see the light on it, I'm still coming home
Release me
'Cause you love me, you'll let me go

You should be yourself, well careful for what you wish for
It's a cloudy day in Hell and here comes the downpour
We'll save some sunshine, it's banging on the front door
What’s on the other side is just another lie
Tell me why we’re wasting both our time

'Cause we’re not getting any younger now
We're not getting any closer to the truth
And there's nothing left to figure out
So, woa-oa-oah

So why don't you release me
Release me
Release me
I see the light on it, I’m still coming home
Release me
'Cause you love me, you'll let me go
Release me
I see the light on it, I'm still coming home
Release me
'Cause you love me, you'll let me go
Release me
I see the light on it, I'm still coming home
Release me
'Cause you love me, you'll let me go
Release me

Don't take me
For I am the one
Don't touch me
Or I will come down

Only to find that it was not mine

You put me in your coat of arms
I am your saint, I'm your saviour
You put me in your coat of arms
My reign is short from misbehaviour
I am your saint, I'm your saint

Don't make me wait
For I am the one
Don't push me down
Or we will both drown
Both drown

I've given you my faith
Only to die from one in exile
I've given you my land
Only to find that it was not mine

You put me in your coat of arms

You put me in your coat of arms

There is something you should know
I can't sing a love song anymore
There's something going on
And I can't turn my back on it anymore

How can we go to sleep at night
And lay there in our beds?
When we know what's going on
With the world today

Is it in my head?
Am I the only one?
Is it in my head?
When the war has just began
We look away, look away, look away, look away
Look away, look away, look away, look away
Is it in my head?
Is it in my head?
Look away, look away, no

There's something in the air at night
That feels so different
And I don't understand
I didn't see this one coming

How can we go to sleep at night
And lay there in our beds?
When we know what's going on
With the world today

I'm on my way to pick you up
Stole my old man's car so just wish me luck
Guess I am my fathers son
Because he did the same
When he was my age
Sirens and blue flashing lights
In a 30 zone I’m pushing 95
Just tryna get to you in time
Where you’re supposed to be
Right here with me
Life goes by fast
Will it slow down
We got older
Where did it go now
Back in time when all we had was you and me
These memories

Do you remember when we were young?
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

As I pull up at your door
Your eyes light up like we’ve not met before
Yeah some things are still the same
But everyday is brand new
being with you
Life goes by fast
Will it slow down
We grew older
Where did it go now
You are, you are all i need
To keep reminding me of
Back in time when all we had was you and me
these memories

Do you remember when we were young?
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

There is something you should know
I can't sing a love song anymore
There's something going on
And I can't turn my back on it anymore

How can we go to sleep at night
And lay there in our beds?
When we know what's going on
With the world today

Is it in my head?
Am I the only one?
Is it in my head?
When the war has just began
We look away, look away, look away, look away
Look away, look away, look away, look away
Is it in my head?
Is it in my head?
Look away, look away, no

There's something in the air at night
That feels so different
And I don't understand
I didn't see this one coming

How can we go to sleep at night
And lay there in our beds?
When we know what's going on
With the world today

Is it in my head?
Am I the only one?
Is it in my head?
When the war has just began
We look away, look away, look away, look away
Look away, look away, look away, look away
Is it in my head?
Am I the only the one?
Is it in my head?
When the war has just began
We look away, look away, look away, look away
Look away, look away, look away, look away, no

Oh, God, I'm terrified when I’m not with you
No matter how I tried, I was feeling blue

You walked into my life, showed me something new
Oh, baby, when you're gone I don't know what I should do

’Cause only you can make me fly like I'm Superman
How you make feel like this, hard to understand
When I need a hero, you'll be my hero
When I feel the darkness, you'll be the light
'Cause only you can make me fly like I'm Superman

When all my hope is gone and I'm caving in
When I can see the light from the dark within

When you're around I'm above all the clouds
You don't let me down

The more I go, the less it seems to make sense
Not sleeping in my bed, can really feel the distance
How can we fix what has already been stolen?
The emptiness inside is eating us alive
I don't want to waste our precious time

’Cause we're not getting any younger now
We're not getting any closer to the truth
And there’s nothing left to figure out
So, woa-oa-oah

So why don't you release me
Release me
Release me
I see the light on it, I'm still coming home
Release me
'Cause you love me, you'll let me go

You should be yourself, well careful for what you wish for
It's a cloudy day in Hell and here comes the downpour
We'll save some sunshine, it's banging on the front door
What’s on the other side is just another lie
Tell me why we’re wasting both our time

'Cause we’re not getting any younger now
We're not getting any closer to the truth
And there's nothing left to figure out
So, woa-oa-oah

So why don't you release me
Release me
Release me
I see the light on it, I’m still coming home
Release me
'Cause you love me, you'll let me go

Don't take me
For I am the one
Don't touch me
Or I will come down

I've given you my faith
Only to die from one in exile
I've given you my land
Only to find that it was not mine

You put me in your coat of arms
I am your saint, I'm your saviour
You put me in your coat of arms
My reign is short from misbehaviour
I am your saint, I'm your saint

Don't make me wait
For I am the one
Don't push me down
Or we will both drown
Both drown

I've given you my faith
Only to die from one in exile
I've given you my land
Only to find that it was not mine

You put me in your coat of arms
I am your saint, I'm your saviour

I wish that you would hear me cry in the darkness
And turn it into a call for action
I'm searchin' for a melody that will make you see
All the pain you've put me through

And I know in a minute
I'll be the lonely one
And I'm so good at forgivin'
I'll do it time after time after time

Love is just a lie
Love is just a lie
(Love is just a)
Love is just a lie, lie, lie
(Love is just a)

Help me to remember why I'm designing
Your picture perfect hallucination
Now I'm diggin' for a memory
That could remedy all the ways that I love you

And I know in a minute
I'll be the lonely one
And I'm so good at forgivin'
I'll do it time after time after time

Why fall in love when you can always fall asleep
Why follow your heart when you can't follow your dreams
Love in all these movies girl, it's never what it seems
But oh I miss that feelin' baby, make me believe
Love is just a lie but baby I might try
I can write a lullaby and make your heart come back to life
Revive this feelin', your wounds are healin'
Show me how to love you like there is no fucking ceiling

And I know in a minute (love is just a lie, love is just a lie)
I'll be the lonely one (love is just a lie, love is just a lie)
And I'm so good at forgivin'
I'll do it time after time after time

Love is just a lie, lie, lie
(Love is just a lie, lie, lie)
Love is just a lie, lie, lie
(Love is just a lie, lie, lie)
Love is just a lie, lie, lie
(Love is just a lie, lie, lie)
Love is just a lie, lie, lie
(Love is just a lie, lie, lie)
Love is just a lie, lie, lie

Oh, God, I'm terrified when I’m not with you
No matter how I tried, I was feeling blue

You walked into my life, showed me something new
Oh, baby, when you're gone I don't know what I should do

’Cause only you can make me fly like I'm Superman
How you make feel like this, hard to understand
When I need a hero, you'll be my hero
When I feel the darkness, you'll be the light
'Cause only you can make me fly like I'm Superman
Like a Superman

When all my hope is gone and I'm caving in
When I can see the light from the dark within

You walked into my life, showed me something new
Oh, baby, when you're gone I don’t know what I should do

’Cause only you can make me fly like I'm Superman

When I need a hero, you’ll be my hero
When I feel the darkness, you'll be the light
'Cause only you can make me fly like I'm Superman
Like a Superman

When you’re around I can reach for the sky
I won't look down, going high at night
When you're around I'm above all the clouds
You don't let me down

'Cause only you can make me fly like I'm Superman

The more I go, the less it seems to make sense
Not sleeping in my bed, can really feel the distance
How can we fix what has already been stolen?
The emptiness inside is eating us alive
I don't want to waste our precious time

’Cause we're not getting any younger now
We're not getting any closer to the truth
And there’s nothing left to figure out
So, woa-oa-oah

So why don't you release me
Release me
Release me
I see the light on it, I'm still coming home
Release me
'Cause you love me, you'll let me go

You should be yourself, well careful for what you wish for
It's a cloudy day in Hell and here comes the downpour
We'll save some sunshine, it's banging on the front door
What’s on the other side is just another lie
Tell me why we’re wasting both our time

'Cause we’re not getting any younger now
We're not getting any closer to the truth
And there's nothing left to figure out
So, woa-oa-oah

So why don't you release me

Don't take me
For I am the one
Don't touch me
Or I will come down

I've given you my faith
Only to die from one in exile
I've given you my land
Only to find that it was not mine

You put me in your coat of arms
I am your saint, I'm your saviour
You put me in your coat of arms
My reign is short from misbehaviour
I am your saint, I'm your saint

Don't make me wait
For I am the one
Don't push me down
Or we will both drown
Both drown

I've given you my faith
Only to die from one in exile
I've given you my land
Only to find that it was not mine

You put me in your coat of arms
I am your saint, I'm your saviour
You put me in your coat of arms

I wish that you would hear me cry in the darkness
And turn it into a call for action
I'm searchin' for a melody that will make you see
All the pain you've put me through

And I know in a minute
I'll be the lonely one
And I'm so good at forgivin'
I'll do it time after time after time

Love is just a lie
Love is just a lie
(Love is just a)
Love is just a lie, lie, lie
(Love is just a)

Help me to remember why I'm designing
Your picture perfect hallucination
Now I'm diggin' for a memory
That could remedy all the ways that I love you

And I know in a minute
I'll be the lonely one
And I'm so good at forgivin'
I'll do it time after time after time

Why fall in love when you can always fall asleep
Why follow your heart when you can't follow your dreams
Love in all these movies girl, it's never what it seems
But oh I miss that feelin' baby, make me believe
Love is just a lie but baby I might try
I can write a lullaby and make your heart come back to life
Revive this feelin', your wounds are healin'
Show me how to love you like there is no fucking ceiling

And I know in a minute (love is just a lie, love is just a lie)
I'll be the lonely one (love is just a lie, love is just a lie)

There is something you should know
I can't sing a love song anymore
There's something going on
And I can't turn my back on it anymore

How can we go to sleep at night
And lay there in our beds?
When we know what's going on
With the world today

Is it in my head?
Am I the only one?
Is it in my head?
When the war has just began
We look away, look away, look away, look away
Look away, look away, look away, look away
Is it in my head?
Is it in my head?
Look away, look away, no

There's something in the air at night
That feels so different
And I don't understand
I didn't see this one coming

How can we go to sleep at night
And lay there in our beds?
When we know what's going on
With the world today

Is it in my head?
Am I the only one?
Is it in my head?
When the war has just began
We look away, look away, look away, look away
Look away, look away, look away, look away
Is it in my head?
Am I the only the one?
Is it in my head?
When the war has just began
We look away, look away, look away, look away
Look away, look away, look away, look away, no

Not sleeping in my bed, can really feel the distance
How can we fix what has already been stolen?
The emptiness inside is eating us alive
I don't want to waste our precious time

’Cause we're not getting any younger now
We're not getting any closer to the truth
And there’s nothing left to figure out
So, woa-oa-oah

So why don't you release me
Release me

Release me

You should be yourself, well careful for what you wish for
It's a cloudy day in Hell and here comes the downpour
We'll save some sunshine, it's banging on the front door
What’s on the other side is just another lie
Tell me why we’re wasting both our time

'Cause we’re not getting any younger now
We're not getting any closer to the truth

How can we fix what has already been stolen?
The emptiness inside is eating us alive
I don't want to waste our precious time

’Cause we're not getting any younger now
We're not getting any closer to the truth
And there’s nothing left to figure out
So, woa-oa-oah

So why don't you release me
Release me
Release me
I see the light on it, I'm still coming home
Release me
'Cause you love me, you'll let me go

You should be yourself, well careful for what you wish for
It's a cloudy day in Hell and here comes the downpour
We'll save some sunshine, it's banging on the front door
What’s on the other side is just another lie
Tell me why we’re wasting both our time

'Cause we’re not getting any younger now
We're not getting any closer to the truth
And there's nothing left to figure out
So, woa-oa-oah

So why don't you release me
Release me
Release me
I see the light on it, I’m still coming home
Release me
'Cause you love me, you'll let me go
Release me
I see the light on it, I'm still coming home
Release me
'Cause you love me, you'll let me go
Release me
I see the light on it, I'm still coming home
Release me
'Cause you love me, you'll let me go
Release me

I'm on my way to pick you up
Stole my old man's car so just wish me luck
Guess I am my fathers son
Because he did the same
When he was my age
Sirens and blue flashing lights
In a 30 zone I’m pushing 95
Just tryna get to you in time
Where you’re supposed to be
Right here with me
Life goes by fast
Will it slow down
We got older
Where did it go now
Back in time when all we had was you and me
These memories

Do you remember when we were young?
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

As I pull up at your door
Your eyes light up like we’ve not met before
Yeah some things are still the same
But everyday is brand new
being with you
Life goes by fast
Will it slow down
We grew older
Where did it go now
You are, you are all i need
To keep reminding me of
Back in time when all we had was you and me
these memories

Do you remember when we were young?

Udgi' det, split min' royalties og tag på druk for hva', det' værd
En knægt sagde, jeg burd' at diss' Kesi og Gilli
Men jeg har kun respekt for de drenge, ikk' så hidsig
Ingen had her omkring, knægt, hva' fuck sku' det hjælp'?
Hadet kommer ofte af, man ikk' er stolt af sig selv
Jeg hopped' ud af 5C i går, ""Hvor var din AMG?""
Spørg' enhver, der kender Nix, man, det' stadig SEP
SK og NC tatoveret på sin arm
Og de snakker loyalitet, men se at kom' igang
Jeg' brændvarm som damerne i min DM
Der tror, de gern' vil ha' et styk' af NI-X-E-N
Jeg' bare frisk ude af flyet, ingen forsinkelse
Stadig den vigtigste på economi i mængden

Jeg tog en tur gennem blokken for mig selv
Med det kiwi-grønne kush, der sender rollingerne hjem
Har en stemme i mit hoved, der sagde: ""Nixen, du' dope""
(Burd' gå hjem og mix' det op og gi' det til dem ligesom blow)
Nixen, du' dope
(Burd' gå hjem og mix' det op og gi' det til dem ligesom blow)
Burd' gå hjem og mix' det op og gi' det til dem ligesom narko
(Burd' gå hjem og mix' det op og gi' det til dem ligesom blow)

Tilbage i fuld effekt, det' Mr. X i midten
Spørg omkring, din yndlingsrapper kender Nixen
Ren weed i min duffelbag, stinker som moderne rap
For fuck jeres top fem, hvis ikk' jeg er der, mand
Det' ikk' fornuften, som der banker mod jeres hjerneskal
Jeg' mindst tre eller fire - fem i værste fald
Har du aldrig hørt på ulvene i en stjernenat?
Og malet vindens farver, siden jeg fucked' rundt i Herlev, svans
Tramper dig i hovedet, det' min Herlev-dans
Fifty-fifty i den bitch, det' en Herlev-drink
Det' bare en rap ting at rap' om, hvor du' fra
Jeg føler ofte, byen aldrig får en rapper ligesom mig

Jeg tog en tur gennem blokken for mig selv
Med det kiwi-grønne kush, der sender rollingerne hjem
Har en stemme i mit hoved, der sagde: ""Nixen, du' dope""
(Burd' gå hjem og mix' det op og gi' det til dem ligesom blow)

Når verden larmer som en hyletone
Eller en tonedøv på en xylofon
Og du mest af alt har lyst til at hænge dig selv i lysekronen
Sidder ved psykologen, min hjerne er på flyfunktion
Ingen ønsker at finde sandheden ligesom et fyldt kondom
Kan ik' give skylden på nogen
Kigger på hende hun har øjne så store som møllehjul
Og gyldenbrune krøller, solen danser ind ad vinduet
Hun kigger søgende og konstaterer at jeg nok ik' er døende
Men bare skal acceptere at livet gror der hvor man ligger frøene
Hendes øjne er smaragdgrønne
Hun siger at jeg skal passe på mig selv og giv slip på arvesynden
Kan ik' la' være at dagdrømme mig væk derfra
Hægter mig af og lader autopiloten tale, hoved i dvale
Hovedperson forlod lokalet uden at tabe

Ansigt
Jeg snyder kun mig selv
Vi vil ik' tabe ansigt
Vi snyder kun os selv
Man ka' se det på dit ansigt
Du snyder kun dig selv
Jeg vil ik' tabe ansigt
Jeg snyder kun mig selv

Når verden larmer som en hyletone
På afveje som et one night stand i en bryllupskjole
Destruktiv som en masochist med en sømpistol
Brænde på det berømte bål, vi jagter de forsømte mål
Brænder op og genopstår fra asken som en fønixfugl
Alt er godt, mand dig op, gør din ting, pas dit job
Jeg har det fint siger vi, men hvad betyder det
La' vreden voks, totalt i boks, inderst inde, ligesom os
Smil til kameraet og pres dig selv til det yderste
Jeg har det fint det er løgn, tænker jeg, mens jeg svarer det
Hun spørger mig hvordan jeg har det, jeg magter ikke at forklare det
Hun er min soulmate jeg undgår øjenkontakten
Gemmer mig bag mit stoneface og tager den sidste smøg i aften
Mine streger under øjnene er meget tykke, paranoid type
Jeg bliver forfulgt af min egen skygge
Jeg lader som om det hele for kører for mig
Prøver på at gemme mig forstenet og revnet
Med tvivlen malet i mit

Ansigt
Jeg snyder kun mig selv
Vi vil ik' tabe ansigt
Vi snyder kun os selv
Man ka' se det på dit ansigt
Du snyder kun dig selv

Nigga slidin' (Helly, I'm fuckin' with you)
And I'm ridin' with 'em
(Helluva made this beat, baby)

I used to get the pack when I was young (Me too, yeah)
Now I do it for my son
Everybody behind me like I'm the one (You is, nigga)
No strap gon' get it done (Brrt)
Double back but bring a ton
Catch him lackin', we gon' punish you
Sold him one, but yeah, I fronted two
Ran up in a money suit
No mask on, just a monkey suit, fuck you mean? (Facts, look)

My lil' bitch in the D, she a nurse in the day (Oh yeah?)
My lil doggy from the East just put me up on a play (What up, dude?)
My OG 'nem ate with Meech and 'nem, back in the day (Facts)
When you sign with me that shit come with a brick and a K (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

My lil' freaky bitch Tasha used to hang with the costers
Now she one-on-one and mixin', I ain't talkin' no pasta
Yeah, I'm servin' 'em rastas (Ayy), all they coppin' is bales
Yeah, they leave with twenty-four and that's on top of the twelve
They play my shit in the county, bitch, I'm on top of the jail (Yeah)
They say that letter was loud, I got 'em watchin' the mail (Yeah)

I ain't dropped in a year so the streets been fiendin'
I'll hop out that Rolls truck, go and slide in a demon
I'm in a triple white Ghost, snowin', slopes (Yeah)
I fuck with the D, I damn near signed DeJ Loaf (Ask her)
Niggas talkin' big work and ain't never sold dope
My niggas doin' fed time and I'm just here to give 'em hope (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

I brung a hundred grams of tan, Gotti ain't think I knew the ropes
I got a blender in my suitcase, can get it to you for the two-eight
Bitches sayin' I'm two-faced, that debit card my new bae
Once that wire touch, I'm good, I ain't put shit up, baby, I'm Dugg
Which one of these lil' niggas would? (Yeah)
All in Vegas throwin' up my hood
Yeah, I'm straight, baby, get right
Knew you was fuckin', shit, that's light

I had two-fifty at the MGM, me and Dugg, synonym
Both had the trap jumpin', payin' like an ATM
My lil' niggas rockin' soldier rags like they Soulja Slim
Thick lil' bitch from New York named Kim, all she rock is Timbs, look
Niggas hatin' but we don't see 'em
Niggas locked, we hollerin' free 'em
We turned grams into bricks, we turned thousands to M's

I'll turn this bitch into a rat, orderin' tenders, all a tap
Ain't gotta ask, baby, I'm that
Yeah, I'm him, don't do no 'voiding, baby, that's them
Shout out my lawyer, happy I'm free
Text my plug, yeah, I need it

Uh, why would I need a plug, nigga, when I'm the plug? (Duh)
Ain't a hood in America don't show me love (Yeah)
I'm about to put like five mil' on Dugg (Ffft, beep)
Tell him go sign every nigga he know from the mud (Here I come)
Real bosses (Bosses), fuck with only bosses (Ayy, bosses)
Real street nigga, I can sense the crosses (Ayy, on God)
Street nigga, I ain't takin' no more losses (No more losses)
Let's count a mil' by hand, I'm exhausted

Since we against all odds, bro, you can keep all yours
Shit, we gon' split all mines, forever throw my fours
We probably kill all fives, bro, I don't trust no hoes
And I ain't coppin' no pleas, bitch, I been on my toes
Since I done got my cheese, might spend half on my mama
The other half on business, I'm tryna double up
Bitch, you get left if you ain't come with us, let's run it up
Do whatever it take, she like, ""Dugg, one enough""
Still bought two to be safe
You know we fuck with the 10, you know we fuck with the Bay
Whatever we spent on the sixth, we gon' make double the eighth
Remember my niggas was starvin', now they stuffin' they plates
The judge dismissed all charges like, ""Good luck and be safe""

Ordered up the Rolls truck, that was double the Wraith (Yeah)
Streets say I'm one of a kind (I am), I just can't be replaced (I can't)
Richard Mille, two-fifty for whatever in the safe (Woo)
Glock-10, FN, both of them on the waist (Woo)
My men on the parole, they cannot leave the states (Damn)
Matchin' Dracos for the twins, they were both on the case (Damn)
I fuck with Jay so I ain't sippin' Henn', I'm drinkin' D'usse
I fuck with Dugg and my lil' college bitch at Michigan State

I'm sellin' drugs all in the Nash', I got Michigan plates
That lil' shit they said was a five, I broke it down in a shake
She'll bend it over for me and show me what it is (Ayy)
I took her from a lame, taught her how to live
She like to fuck me in my chains, I even bought her crib (Shawty a freak)
She was starvin' with doggy, before he left she was callin'
Like fuck whoever, I'm all in, I know you heard I was ballin'
She tryna get on the court
I'ma hold it down for us, bro, just pass me the torch
Yeah, this bitch go over two, I never drive it in sport
Shit, I'm just happy I'm ridin'
Shout out to the 10, bitch, we tied in
Anywhere in the country, nigga, we top ten

När elefanter dansar över rosornas bädd
Och dansen varit vild och exalterad
Då får man lov att säga med fog är jag rädd
Att den rabatten var nog felplacerad
Som en ros i barmen Fatumeh
Som en nål i armen Fatumeh
När elefanter dansar då är djävulen lös
För han tycker om att rosorna beskåda
Och han kockar dig så lusteligt till stordåd min tös
Ja ni hetsar upp varandra ni båda
Som en blues på kvällen Fatumeh
Som en natt i cellen Fatumeh
Jag minns när du var liten du var så söt och snäll
Nu tänker du mest på heroinet
Bland dansande elefanter är du en bagatell
Betänk det och så torka bort flinet
Som när Krueger sköt sig Fatumeh
Som när farmor snöt sig Fatumeh
Som när Krueger sköt sig Fatumeh
Som när farmor snöt sig Fatumeh
Ja, vad hade du att göra i dessa kvarter
Det kan man faktiskt fråga sig min sköna
Nu får du aldrig vila på klöverängar mer
Nej du får aldrig mera älska i det gröna
Det var felplanering Fatumeh
Som en överdosering Fatumeh
Så ta nu dina rosor och lägg dem i en grop
Eller låt dem flyga bort genom ditt galler
Eller ska elefanterna få krossa alltihop
Medan natten obönhörligen faller
Som en trettitons truck Fatumeh
Som en sista suck Fatumeh
Som en trettitons truck Fatumeh
Som en sista suck Fatumeh

Rippa on the beat, bitch
Ayy, my sister right here
Ayy, Kita, what we tell them hoes?
Ayy, ayy, hey
DJ Swift on the track

You ain't gotta love me, baby, what I tell hoes
Go to trippin', I'ma buy me some Chanel, ho
Then I'ma rock this shit in front you on a sailboat
Hit the 'Gram, go to flexin' from a cellphone
Independent big girl and she got her own apartment
Every night she set the mood and she don't like to argue
A lot of bad bitches still livin' with they mama
A lot of bad bitches still livin' with they mama
A lot of bad bitches still livin' with they mama
A lot of bad bitches still livin' with they mama
I do it, I stick it, I stick it, I do it
Suppressor, I'm pressure, but this is an Uzi
I fuck with lil' Britney and shout out lil' Scooby
It's up there, I'm ign'ant, stop talkin', let's do it
Word around town, I'm with another nigga bitch
Gotta be a lie, I'm busy dealin' with my kids
You love your ho then cuff her, fuck what other niggas think
Her bootyhole retarded, pussy good, her mouth the same
She know that we beefin' and she started runnin' game
She know we ain't speaking, can't get caught up in her ways
Squash her from behind, got her hollerin', that's on gang
Slap her nine times, royal ride, what you think?
Said free my nigga Malucci, white toe, headband, it's Gucci
Before they started twerking they used to pop the coochie
Before you started rapping, you weren't gangster, you was pussy
You know you scared, uh, hold up, there go OG Boobie
I'm runnin' the bread up, I got Huli right here coolin'
Controlling me, yeah love, I got shooters who got shooters
Exposing a real nigga, that's some shit that we not doin'
We hide the flaws of our brother, go ask Ralo how we movin'
OG Ken drop me off, I just jump out and go stupid
One way, the dumb way, I think y'all know how we do it
I'm paying luxury tax, you know, yeah, I can't relax
I'm on the phone with Gucci Mane, ""Gato, vato need you in the back""
I'm in the building, we can relax
Baby come near me, Dreka be strapped
We got some children, they gon' be strapped
Say you wan' kill me, nigga, what's happ'?
I got the Urkel goggles on, I've been flexing on my phone
Hold up, nigga, watch your tone, what the fuck is you on?
Big boom from the shoulder, big boom with some chrome
Dude thought he was in power, got removed from his throne
Bitch, I'm pressure on my end, I'm pressure on my end
I'm pressure on my end, I'm pressure on my end
Bitch, I'm pressure on my end, I'm pressure on my end
Bitch, I'm pressure on my end, I'm pressure on my end
I forgot what I was saying, retarded, when I walk in the room
You can't tell I'm ready to die, man? What's happening with you?
Rockin' a shirt with a collar, I got it, we up
I feel like you wasted my time and we up
Jump in your shit, got a problem, what's up?
You think I don't got it, I'm 'bout it, what's up?
You know how I'm rockin', you know I don't bluff
Walkin' you down, I'll stand in your guts
I do not care if my brother cut up
Meant to say public, it must be the crush

Anybody that knows me, if you've ever been around me
Or ever had the opportunity to be blessed to be in my presence
I'm upright, independent, and fearless at all times
I don't engage in no bullshit
I mean, unless it's with my lil' team
You know, other than that, you know
All relationships are circumstantial to me
I'm pressure

Jump in the dashboard, I'm thuggin', I'm playin Rover
I still was sufferin' internally whenever you came over
You told me whatever decision I make that we would remain closer
But you kinda changed over, just try to remain sober
Kick dirt on my name, I maintain, then I stay focused
They get on Instagram and take shots at me, thinkin' I ain't noticed
I got a thing on top my neck, it got a brain on it (It do)
I got a thing inside my chest, it got some stains on it (I do)
I hit the shower, go work out, and I don't think on it
You draw your sword, get met with force, you can bank on it
I'm Uptown in a Porsche, got my name on it
On South 12th, but of course, got my name on it
On Carolina and on Alice, got my name on it
Go ask Lil Derrick on Saint Joseph, got my name on it
Pressure on my end, now it's time to wild out
We don't do no drive-bys, we spin through and we hop out
(Jump straight out and run them bitches, all...)

Thug nigga from the trenches never had a heart
Drug dealer, contract killer, loyal from the start (Start)

They say I'm pussy and they say I'm fake but I say

I'm are who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh
Shittin' on 'em, I just switched from a Wraith to a Lamb,' yeah-eh-eh

Got into it with my bitch, caught up while I'm tourin'
Tryna see if shawty on my dick, wonder what she doin'
You know me, real G, I text ask her, ""How it's goin'""
She responded nothin', lookin' like to me you havin' fun
Look for my mama when I try to look inside my woman
Told my bae, ""I wish I woulda found you back when I was bummin'""
Stayed away from all the bullshit, them niggas said I'm runnin'
Time passed over now you see that I was chasin' money
Posted on Maryland, me and Von, his mama tearin' just once
Know you seen up in the parish, like check it out that's my lil' youngin'
Nigga don't wanna sell me a brick of dope, act like my money funny
Damn what you sayin' gangsta, you gon' make me take it from you
Some hoes say I'm handsome, some of them they say I'm ugly
Some say that I'm the realest but I still ain't sayin' nothin'

I'm are who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh

Tryna run me up a check, late nights, early mornings
Diamonds 'round my neck, they really wet, I could've copped a foreign
Givenchy shoes, I came a long way from Ralph Lauren
Cut off my ex because my new bitch put that pussy on me
They watchin' every move I make, I guess I'm settin' trends
I had to focus on the check, told myself, ""Fuck a friend""
Committed crimes so many times but I don't give a damn
I are who you say I am
Posted on high street, me and roof 'cause we been really thuggin'
Convicted felon with a dirty pistol, bitch I'm steady clutchin'
No drama sittin' in my cell like check out my lil' cousin
Can't trust these hoes because I know they come a dime a dozen
RIP to Quahfee, know my nigga at them Heaven gates
She ain't never really made love, I'm him just like Kevin Gates

20 of 'em comin', I switched to another spot
Reversible stock carbon, a new convertible drop
I was gambling with shawty, I put some work on the block
I tested her, she held a lil' quarter bird at her spot
I ain't into bustin' down a Rollie, bustin' down on bales
Don't wanna fuck me, I won't argue baby, oh well
The 18 Willard, the lever get 'em movin' mils
Millionaire dollar bond in 30 minutes and I made bail
I graduated, the square's outta town, at the room cookin' at the hotel (yeah, yeah)
Ike's is outta reach, I'ma move the race car (Vroom)
Hated on us and they know who they are
Still livin' large as I aim for the stars
I'm a BreadWinner don and I came from the slums
I got a stain on my arm, weather through the storm
If I tell you that I love you then you can't do nothin' wrong
Surrounded by steppers, I got control in this bitch
I'll book you for a show and get you showed in this bitch
Tell that boy Kentrell I love you with all my heart
Now we ride around in Wraiths with a push button start (vroom)

Cause I'm are who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh
Shittin' on 'em, I just switched from a Wraith to a Lamb,' yeah-eh-eh
I upgraded from nobody to the one who the man, yeah (to the man, yeah)

We've been through it all, though it could be worse
We've been moved around in a state of alert
There's nothing new or sharp about the cutting edge
If they build a wall, let's jump the fence, I'm over this

Cold stares can never put the fear in me
What we built here is godly
They can't gentrify the heart of kings
Let's just not talk about it
If I make a move, you're coming with me

What about the love? Coming with me
What about the labor? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
People that you came with coming with me
What about the love? Coming with me
What about the labor? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me

(Let's go shake down) Until we get what we need, oh yeah
(Okay now) I'm okay now
(Just don't stay down) Yeah, can't hold me down
(Let's go shake down) And let it fall like the leaves, I want it all

We couldn't stand to see our children shot dead in the streets
But when I finally took a knee
Them crackers took me out the league
Now I'm not much for games
But I play for keeps
And we salute King James for using his change
To create some equal opportunities

Cold stares can never put the fear in me
There's a movement we've been groovin' on
You can move or stay your ass asleep
Let's just not talk about it
Everything they tried to hide
We're taking back for yours and mine

What about the love? Coming with me
What about the labor? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
People that you came with coming with me
What about the love? Coming with me
What about the labor? Coming with me
What about the seed? It's coming with me
People that you came with, ya coming with me

Stop and stare, my reflection
Lost and found, fresh out of Heaven
Countin' my blessings, make a call
Just to feel a connection

I've had some bad days like a Monday
But I can't let it faze me
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Never lose my cool
Slippin' and slidin' on these icy roads
Don't you give up when you're losing control
Leaning on all of my faith and my hope
Searching for my pot of gold

They know that I-I-I-I, I, I'm good by myself
I keep it in dri-i-i-i-ive, there's no turning back, whoa-oh, whoa
I'm tellin' you I-I-I-I, I'm good by myself
Oh, I-I-I-I, I drive

Shining bright, I'm fluorescent
Look at me now, pure like a reverend
Gon' do what I say any way, anyhow
There's no second guessing

Retoration
The act of restorin' back to it's original glory

Two of the illest back in the kitchen
Fillin' prescriptions, fiends itchin'
We serve 'em through the chain linked fences
Beamers and Benzes on 24 inches
Reefer smoke thick as the tension from them bitch-ass niggas
Fuck them bitch-ass niggas, Route
They broke and they assed out, that's what they mad 'bout
While I'm in the stash house on the internet checkin' the latest project progress
They never understand my underground success
The amount of love I get, but I digress
It's obvious that I'm above all this 'cause I'm a Jet
Center Edge Territory, the collective, Mos Def and Jay Elec
Andretti fresh, a pair of thousand dollar steps
When I left I threw up my set

I guess everybody gangsters, everybody servin'
Everybody slangin', everybody claimin' Crip or Blood
Everybody bangin', ain't nobody tryna take the fall
They all pointin' fingers, yea I'm tryna win, I'm all out of favors
We started with nothin' so hustlin' our nature
We come from a place where a murder make you famous
We built us a business, nobody gave us naythan
The underrated, Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton
Pitch a bag to the lawyer to fight the case
They got me back in the kitchen without the apron
Bucket low like fuck it though
Hell yea, I'm fresh up out the gutter but she love it though
Money in the envelope

Arm full of riches we been evicted
Shit been official, that there my status you know the business
Convince the kid to get on a track and we go to spittin'
It's Cleopatra, you know we at it, come get a listen
Best pay attention, this is a dynasty in the building
We hit the stage, they up to the front, they tryna get pictures
It's lemonade that's up in the air, we keep it too litty
The bitches stare when we hit the place, we come to get busy
No time to spare, it's 3-2-1, back to the mission
We blowin' on something different, dispensary flavor hittin'
We leave you in the past, the jealous be shiftin' different
The schedule full of digits, you guess it but it was written
Ba-bang

Sunset, on the ocean, that's Pacific
New whips, new tiffs, now your wrist lit
You can get anything off your wish list
Every day is Christmas (I got you)
Look, I promise you won’t wanna miss this (I got you)
All I got is bread like a biscuit (biscuit)
Got a secret location, unlisted
We can get twisted (woo)
I don’t wanna wait (hey)
I don’t need a break (hey)
You just bring the gift (hey)
I’ma bring the cake (uh-huh)
Go for two rounds
Light a spliff (uh-huh)
You laying next to a star, make a wish (a wish)

Anywhere you wanna go, scratch it off your list
You wouldn’t even wanna cry if you imagine this

Almost made you wanna throw the towel in (hey)
Almost made you wanna trade the style in (uh-oh)

100 stacks, run it back, Hester
Double up, one more time, no pressure (no pressure)
I believe in you, so you next up
I put diamonds in your cross, God bless ya
You put the work in (woo), you deserve that
Hard work pays off, I know you heard of that (heard of that)
Slow it down, lemme show you how to work that (oh)
That coupe you was dreamin' 'bout, you can swerve that (it's yours)
You just gotta take a chance, take control of that
You just gotta chase the dream, get a hold of that (uh-huh)
Then you put in overtime, nothing over that
Then you do it one more time, gotta run it back

All my man dem are ill and gully
Body get left at the bottom of the gully
Man will get wrapped up like (Trackerz)

I'm just sitting here

You can't make Ps if you spit so poor

Where are they now? (Where did you find her?)
""They're not around no more""
""They're not around no more""
""They're not around no more""
""They're not around no more""
""They're not around no more""

Now, before I finish, let me just say. I did not come here to show out. Did not come here to impress you. To tell you the truth, when I leave here, I'm gone, and I don't care what you think about me. But just remember. When it hits, you defend

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

Dolla $ign! I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

I been at it with my homies, it don't matter, you don't know me
I been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
I been riding 'round the city with my, squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up, take a step back when we roll up cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion
I know I been bussin', no discussion for my family
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games (I'm just a sucker for pain)
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

Uhh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm, dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes, on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
Cause I'm a sucker for pain

Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm just a sucker for pain

More pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain

Give it up for Naughty By Nature!
Hip Hop Hooray
Ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho

You drew a picture of my mornin'
But you couldn't make my day (Hey!)
I'm rockin' and you're yawnin'
But you never look my way (Hey!)
I'm lickin' down your darlin'
In every single way (Hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign
And a green card's on the way

This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your head and shoulder
Brother older, bold enough to fold ya, yo I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made and played it, plus a funky fit
So save yo' flips and tricks for that music and the monkey bit

Triggers from the Grilltown Illtown
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real, so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what you're thinkin', 'cause I'm vampin'

I live and die for Hip Hop, this is Hip Hop for today
I give props to hip-hop, so Hip Hop hooray

Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho
Hip Hop Hooray
Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho

You heard a lot about a brother gainin' mo' ground
Bein' low down, I do the showdown with any little ho round
No! I wanna know who you believe in
Through your funny reasons
Even when I'm sleepin' you think I'm cheatin'
You said: ""I know you, Mr. O.P.P. man
Yo, PP man, won't only see me man""
You should've known when I ain't hit it and step
That I was wit' it a bit, not to consider the rep, heck!
I did your partner 'cause she's hot as a baker
'Cause I'm Naughty by Nature, not 'cause I hate ya
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark
You try to act like somethin' really big is missin'
Even though my name's graffiti-written on your kitten
I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way
Let's start a family today; Hip Hop Hooray

Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho

Hey, ho, hey, ho

Hip Hop, Hip Hip Hop, Hip Hip Hop, Hooray!
There's many hungry hip-hoppers
One reason Hip Hop's tip-top today
Swerve what you heard 'cause I ain't bailin' no hay
Ain't choppin' no crops, but still growin' every day

Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Illtown drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns, beatdowns are found
Don't know me? Don't come around!

Tippy tippy (pause) tippy tippy (pause)
Sometimes creepin' up I eat em up
Your styles are older than Lou Rawls
Peace to this one and that one and them
That way I shout-out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish, neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
Some kitties purr, now call me sir too
Lookin' for her crew; any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put on projects for boots
Step through troops and leave proof
My problem solver's name is Mook
I hittin' woodies in a hoodie
Peace to Josette, Jobete, Jo-Jo, Genae, and every hood G
That's right, my fight is ill
Peace goes to L.O.N.S. and Quest
Nice & Smooth and Cypress Hill

Move over bacon there's something meatier
A natural born lover with love to give free to ya
Meatier, so all you bacon lovers move over
Cause I'm so smooth they should call me Blackanova
I'm not tryin' to say that I'm number one
I'm just a smooth operator that gets the job done
So, let me lick you from head to toe
Realllllllll slowwwwwwwww
Cause ever since I was young I could keep girls sprung
Just by the movement of my tongue
I remember it all started way back
In ummm... Kindergarten!!
Some played with Legos, some played with Play-Doh
But I was feelin' girls like a ripe tomato
And now it's 1990 and you can find me as I dunk
Lockin' up girls like I want
Yes I got a harem, but I don't share em
I collect em like per diem and MMM, you gotta see em
Because the ladies is all I dream of
And not even Anita Baker can give sweeter love
You know why?
Cause I can do it right (4X)
Yesssss I can!

Step up girls and get somethin' to treasure
And welcome to the Smooth Operator's Palace of Pleasure
And if you're wondering if I want it --
I got a Craftmatic with your name written on it
I reminisce saying I take em eight to eighty
But I was just kiddin', no you have to be a lady
Even if you're too young, with the hypest body
I just don't go to a Similac party
So all those of age, we can get intimate
Bumper to bumper, so you can get your fender bent
I treat girls just like pastry
Mmmmmmmmm *smacks lips* Tasty!
Very kinky when it comes to hanky panky
A well known player, but not for the Yankees
I won't say I'm the baddest or portray that role
But I'm of the top two, and my father's gettin' old
I'm taking love to a brand new height
And if loving girls is wrong I don't wanna be right
Cause my man Babyface said that it's no crime
And of course I'll work Diana Ross overtime
You know why?
Cause I can do it right (4X)
Yesssss I can!

If I was on the movies I'd frame Roger Rabbit
Play Spike Lee with Jessica, because she's gotta have it
But I'm not an actor, I'm just a mack
That charms girls as I whisper sweet nothings to attract her
And bring about that feeling of passion
To have her on my body like modern day fashion
Layin' next to me, in pure ecstasy
You're like a door and you know that sex the key
So send your man to the lost and found
I'm bringing something that's world renowned
In other words - good lovin' that's major
I got girls in more areas than a SkyPager
Running around saying, ""Please me, please me, please me""
That's why I say it ain't easy
But I've been able to maintain my status
With ladies macking without if's, and's, or maybe's
And other players just can't understand it
And couldn't keep they girls even if they were branded
I always end up with them on my shelf
*SMACK* I gotta jump back and kiss myself
You know why?
Cause I can do it right (4X)
Yesssss I can!

I sit alone in my four-cornered room
Starin' at candles
Oh, that shit is on?
Let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth

At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
Four walls just starin' at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't livin' right
But I ain't goin' out without a fight
See, every time my eyes close
I start sweatin' and blood starts comin' out my nose
It's somebody watchin' the Ak'
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin' my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say, ""Take a chill, B.""
But fuck that shit! There's a nigga tryin' to kill me
I'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows
Every 20 seconds got me peepin' out my window
Investigatin' the joint for traps
Checkin' my telephone for taps
I'm starin' at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind's playin' tricks on ya

I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me; it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, somethin' ain't right
I feel I'm bein' tailed by the same sucker's headlights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block?
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot?
Or is it the one I beat for 5000 dollars?
Thought he had 'caine, but it was Gold Medal flour
Reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lyin'
I was scareder than a motherfucker
Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick
If it's goin' down, let's get this shit over with
Here they come just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfuckin' trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start gigglin'
Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go, because I'm paranoid
I keep lookin' over my shoulder
And peepin' around corners; my mind is playin' tricks on me

Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't keep a steady hand, because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Prayin' for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift when I drive
Havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I die, then my child'll be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feelin' lonely
My mind is playin' tricks on me

This year Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treatin'
Robbin' little kids for bags
'Til a law man got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble, no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was goin' down we figured
But this wasn't no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now that's the nigga I be seein' in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Droppin' them motherfuckin' B's on him
The more I swung, the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody from punchin' on the concrete
Goddamn, homie!
My mind is playin' tricks on me

Ay-ya, you can read all about the pure breed
Do the bogle dance, man, do the pepperseed

When I step up in the place, a-yo I step correct
Woo-hah, got you all in check
I got that head nod shit that make you break your neck
Woo-hah, got you all in check
And you know we come through to wreck the discotheque
Woo-hah, got you all in check
Throw your hands up in the air, don't ever disrespect
Woo-hah, got you all in check

How dare you ever try to step on my suede shoes?
Top Gun shut down your firm like Tom Cruise
Please let me get down and blow a fuse
Acting fools breaking shit down to molecules
Yo, let me hit you with my ill street blues
Busta Rhymes always headlines the street news
Woo-hah, hey baby girl, don't be confused
Sail my seven seas and enjoy my boat cruise
I know you really want to know who's
Coming through leaving blunt stains and residues
Sorry, homeboy, but your flow sound used
Got to pay your dues, baby, you know the rules
Whenever I travel the world I landcruise
If you choose to fuck around, you get bruised
Now I got you gassed on super unleaded fuels
Give me room, give me some space, yo excuse

When I step up in the place, a-yo I step correct
Woo-hah, got you all in check
I got that head nod shit that make you break your neck
Woo-hah, got you all in check
And you know we come through to wreck the discotheque
Woo-hah, got you all in check
Throw your hands up in the air, don't ever disrespect
Woo-hah, got you all in check

You now rocking with the best
Busta Rhymes coming through from the Flip Mode Squad
Boy Scout's who I be
Straight to your dome, we coming straight to your dome
Bringing all new ruckus to all you rap motherfuckers
Boy Scout's who I be, Flip Mode is the squ-id-ad
Busta Rhymes break it down like this

Yo, which motherfucker stole my flow?
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Throw them type of niggas right out my window
Blast your assm hit you with a direct blow—bahh
Coming through like G.I. Joe
Star Wars, moving ill like Han Solo
Make you bounce around like this was calypso
Always shine 'cause I got the Hi-Pro Glow
You think that you can hide, you think you can lay low
Roll up on your ass like Hawaii 5-0
Macked out with my dreads and my Kangol
Forget the Moet, nigga, just pass the Cisco
Yo, take a trip down to Mexico
Come back with that shit that might make you psycho
Maximum frequencies through your stereo
Sorry this is it but homeboy I got to go

When I step up in the place, a-yo I step correct
Woo-hah, got you all in check
I got that head nod shit that make you break your neck
Woo-hah, got you all in check
And you know we come through to wreck the discotheque
Woo-hah, got you all in check
Throw your hands up in the air, don't ever disrespect

A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
He's also known as a busta (Busta, busta)
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass

So no, I don't want your number (Uh, uh)
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere (No, no)
No, I don't want none of your time and (Uh)

Well a scrub checkin' me, but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm looking like class and he's looking like trash
Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass (Yeah)

Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you live at home with your momma
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you have a shorty that you don't show love
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
Wanna get me with no money

See, if you can't spatially expand my horizon
Then that leaves you in the class with scrubs, never rising
I don't find it surprising and if you don't have the G's
To please me and bounce me here to the coast of overseas
So, let me give you something to think about
Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out
Can't forget the focus on the picture in front of me
You as clear as DVD on digital TV screens
Satisfy my appetite with something spectacular
Check your vernacular, and then I get back to ya
With diamond-like precision, insatiable is what I envision
Can't detect acquisition from your friend's Expedition
Mr. Big Willy, if you really wanna know
Ask Chilli, could I be a silly ho?
Not really, T-Boz and all my señoritas
Are steppin' on your FILA's, but you don't hear me, though

No, I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
‘Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in the gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin' I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise


Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they frontin'; that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!

Arm me with harmony
Dave, drop a load on 'em!

O.P.P., how can I explain it? I'll take it, frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumpin', shoutin', sayin' it
O is for ""other,"" P is for ""peoples',"" scratch your temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple
It's sort of like, well, another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occasion if the other party isn't gamin'
It seems I gotta start the explainin', bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number
And then left feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day
She's what you wanna know about, then you call up
And it’s her girlfriend’s or her cousin’s house?!
It’s not a front, a F to the R to the O to the N to the T;
It's just her boyfriend's at her house
(Oh, that’s why she’s scary)
It's O.P.P., time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship, there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who think it's wrong 'cause I was splittin' and co-hittin' that
Well, if you do, that's O.P.P. and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (Every last homie!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (All the homies!)

Well, for the ladies O.P.P. means somethin' gifted
The first two letters' the same
But the last is somethin' different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five-letter word
Rhymin' with ""cleanness"" or ""meanness""
I won't get into that, I'll do it ah sorta properly
I'll say the last P, hmmm, stands for ""property""
Now lady, here comes a kiss
Blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly
Have you ever known a brother
Who had another, like, a girl or wife
And you just had to stop a toast
'Cause he looked just that nice?
You looked at him, he looked at you
And you knew right away
He had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway!
You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care
'Cause in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finished, y'all can leave
And only y'all would know; and then y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet do'
Now don't be shy
'Cause if you're down I want your hands up high
Say O.P.P. (O.P.P.!) I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (Every last lady!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (All the ladies!)

A scab tried to O.P.P. me, I had a girl and she knew that
Matter of fact, her and my girl was partners that
Had a fall-out, disagreement, yeah, an argument
She tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment
Bust it! That wasn't the thing
It must've been the way she hit the ceiling, 'cause after that she kept on comin' back and catchin' feelings
I said: ""Let's go, my girl is comin', so you gotta leave.""
She said: ""Oh no, I love you, Treach!""
I said: ""Now child, please! You gots to leave
Come grab your coat, right now you gotta go!""
I said: ""Now look you chooses stairs or choose the stair window
This was a fling, a little thing
You shouldn't have brought your heart
'Cause you know I was OPP, hell, from the very start!""
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round
Runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this O.P.P. establishment
You keep yo' mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him!
Excitin', isn't it? A special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta O.P.P. messin' with
Him or her, for sure ain't goin' to admit it
When O.P.P. comes, damn skippy, I'm with it

You just don't know what you do to me

Bad Boy!

Uh..Uh!

Give me all the chicken heads from Pasadena to Medina
Bet Big get in between ya then see ya
Peep the prognosis, doses
Blends and Bends like Twizzlers
Big is fitting to hurt
What's under that skirt?
(Slow down, nigga, you're killin em)
Who fillin 'em with octane?
Got 'em gassed up
'Bout to get blast up, some
The last one, word to mother
Brother miss ’em
I seen it when he kissed 'em at the wake
Made his body shake (Woooooo!)
The high guy in 850i, smoke tint
Rap terror, full chrome Antera's (I like that!)
Two Fives by the livers, the fifth's inconspicuous
Bad Boy slipped in ninety-five? Ridiculous!
My rap lines is like land mines
One step, ka-boom, black suits fill the room
To whom it may concern, Junior M.A.F.I.A.'s the click
Act up, I'll have my honeys Total bust your shit

In the middle of the day now baby
I seem to think of only you, hey, oh yeah
Never thinking for a moment baby
That you've been thinking of me too, yeah, so
I can't wait for the day
That we can be together
I can't let you walk away
Can't you see you and me
Were meant to be, oh baby
And there's nothing left to say

Can't you see what you do to me
Our love was meant to be you were made for me, oh baby
Can't you see what you do to me
Our love was meant to be you were made for me
Every time I see you
I get this feeling, oh yeah
Telling me you are the one
Oh what a feeling, hey
(Let's go)
I can't wait for the day
That we can be together
I can't let you walk away

My, my, my, yes, I must admit
That I have never knew love like this before
And I adore everything about you
I do mean every part of
For meeting someone this beautiful, have mercy
I wanna kiss ya, father
You're the kinda girl I wanna get closer to
Become the most to you like love is supposed to do
Cuz I fell straight into your trap
And since they say love is blind, I'm the Ray Charles of rap
And I'm waiting for you to put me in your mix
Because ya got my nose open like a jar of Vicks
I'll be your king, baby, you can be my queen
Uh, let's stay together like Al Green because

All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I looked for you
And today my dreams come true
You need me and I need you
Love in us is very special
Things you seem to do divine
You look straight into my eyes
Oh, our love was meant to be
Cause our souls touch tenderly
Love is life and life is living very special

Well I must admit that you know how to treat a woman
Don't stop your love, like Keith Sweat, keep it comin'
And our relationship won't ever get dull
Because you're always on my mind even more than my own skull
You're always givin' me respect and chivalry
And I can't wait for your enticing delivery
Staying together is a must
Those Tropicana drinks don't blend as good as us
We were made for each other, meant for one another
Neither one of us needs another lover
And just so it can stay that way
Yo, I'm on your side like Jennifer Holiday because

All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I looked for you
And today my dreams come true
You need me and I need you
Love in us is very special
Things you seem to do divine
You look straight into my eyes
Oh, our love was meant to be
Cause our souls touch tenderly
Love is life and life is living very special

I talk the macho talk but keep my real feelings hidden
But what about that ""Pimpin' Ain't Easy"" stuff? Aw, I was just kiddin'
Cause if we unite, baby, I'd do ya right
Well I hope you meant that mushy stuff you told Barry White
Because I think I know you well enough to be understood
Well let's talk about sex, babe No, not that good
But Spinderella, yes, Miss, I'll still persist
Well since you put it like that Daddy, then we can do this

All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I looked for you
And today my dreams come true
You need me and I need you
Love in us is very special
Things you seem to do divine
You look straight into my eyes
Oh, our love was meant to be
Cause our souls touch tenderly
Love is life and life is living very special

I wanna give ya my love
Cuz you're the only one I'm thinking of
I wanna give my love
Cuz you're the only one I'm thinking of
I wanna give ya my love

I dedicate this record, The Carnival, to all you brothers takin' long trips down south, Virginia, Baltimore, all around the world, and your girl gets this message that you ain't comin' back. She's sittin' back in the room, the lights are off, she's cryin', and then my voice comes in, POW!, in the middle of the night, and this is what I told her for you

Every time I make a run
Girl, you turn around and cry
I ask myself why, oh why
See, you must understand, I can't work a 9 to 5
So I'll be gone 'til November
Said I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
January, February, March, April, May
I see you cryin', but girl, I can't stay
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
And give a kiss to my mother

When I come back, there'll be no need to clock
I'll have enough money to buy out blocks
Tell my brother, ""Go to school in September""
So he won't mess up in summer school in the summer
Tell my cousin, Jerry, wear his condom
If you don't wear condom, you'll see a red lump
Woh oh oh oh
You sucker MC's, you got no flow
I heard your style, you're s-o s-o

Every time I make a run
Girl, you turn around and cry
I ask myself why, oh why
See, you must understand, I can't work a 9 to 5
So I'll be gone 'til November
Said I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
January, February, March, April, May
I see you cryin', but girl, I can't stay
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
And give a kiss to my mother

I had to flip nuttin' and turn it into somethin'
Hip-hop turns to the future rock when I smash a pumpkin
Commit treason, then I'll have a reason to hunt you down
It's only right, it's rappin' season
Yeah, you with the loud voice, posin' like you're top choice
Your voice, I'll make a hearse out of your Rolls Royce
Besides, I got my girl to remember
And I'll commit it that I'll be back in November

Every time I make a run
Girl, you turn around and cry
I ask myself why, oh why
See, you must understand, I can't work a 9 to 5
So I'll be gone 'til November
Said I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November

I'm still not a player, but you still a hater
Elevator to the top, hah, see you later
I'm gone, Penthouse suite, Penthouse freaks
In-house beats, French comtesse, 10 thou' piece
Rent-out lease with an option to buy
Coppin' a 5-0 Benz for when I'm not far up in the sky
Puffin' the lye from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko
From Queens nicknamed Perico
We go back like PA's and wearin' PJ's
Now we reach the peakage, runnin' trains for three days
Who want to ride it? Won't cost you a dollar
Whether soft or harder, of course you still gonna holla
Mama, I'm big, huh? I'll rip my prick through your hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my dick with six rulers
Hold up, Choola, I'm all about gettin' loot

I love from butter pecan to blackberry molass'
I don't discriminate, I regulate every shade of the ass
Long as you show class and pass my test
Fat ass and breasts, highly intelligent bachelorettes
That's the best, I won't settle for less
I want a ghetto brunette with unforgettable sex
I lay your head on my chest, and feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep
Pump Mobb Deep and just spark the leaf
It's hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty, round, brown ho wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down professional, I'ma let you know
Once I put the blows, get your clothes, ‘cause you got to go
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere
You nasty, Twin, I don't care
'Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns
Thick tongue, known to make the chicks come

In the hot tub, poppin' bubbly
Rubbin' your spot, love
Got you screamin', ""Punish me!""
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I stick it even Luke be like
""Don't stop, get it, get it!""

The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged, then
Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
Behold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Six cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me

Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

To my man Ill Will
God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens
God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches
Aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days
We sell it, smoke pays, while all the old folks pray
To Jesús, soakin' their sins in trays of holy water
Odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did
He'll lead a right direction
How you livin'? Large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?

It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

(It's yours)

Break it down
It's yours, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours

I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up
Even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin', Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge

Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this, did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives it's a plus, love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove

Can I kick it? To my Tribe that flows in layers
Right now, Phife is a poem sayer
At times, I'm a studio conveyor
Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?
You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Feel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major
Yes, the Tribe of the game we're the player
As you inhale like a breath of fresh air

Yo, Mack, I don't even understand
How they didn't understand you in that Mary joint
(Yeah, I know, man)
Kick that old robotic, futuristic, George Jetson, crazy joint!

Just like Uniblab, robotic kicking flab
My flavor bidder badder chitter-chatter
Madder than the Mad Hatter
I bet you my shit come out phatter
I got the data to turn your body into anti-matter
And just like a piece of Sizzlean
You'll fit inside my stomach with the eggs and grits between
The king is what I mean, I mean
My man get a cup and put some change inside your hand
Now, hold up, let's make this official
Everybody let's agree that MC's need a tissue
The funk's my only issue
I bet your mama miss you
And I bet the Mack take off, like an MX missile
No more of your whinin' on the charts climbin'
As I make the funk kicking out more harder than a diamond
And if you didn't know who's rhymin'
I guess I'm gonna say ""Craig Mack"" with perfect timin'
You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kickin' mad flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Craig Mack, one thousand degrees
You'll be on your knees, and you'll be burning, begging please
Brother, freeze! This man's undisputed
In deep-rooted funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
This bad MC with stamina like Bruce Jenner
The winner, tasting MC's for dinner
You're crazy like that glue, to think that you could outdo my one-two that's sick like the flu
Boy, I flip, boy, all the time
‘Cause, boy, the rhyme you kickin' ain't worth a dime
Seems like there's no competition in this rap world expedition
You come around, I'll knock you out position
No flav could ever dig a grave, for the Mack
The power pack in black, making cement crack
And here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

Ha! The Mack's dope with more hope than your Pope
But for MC's more knots than rope
I'd like to break it down, down-breaking forsaken
Lords of MC's shakin' with this track that my man's makin'
MC's will run like a bomb threat
I bet, or better yet, make you sweat
Getting hotter than the sun get
Craig Mack is the flav that rocks from here to Tibet
I break all rules with my action
That the Mack sends to MC's, stop relaxin'
This brand new Sherrif that's in town
Getting down, leaving bodies buried in the ground
I set up rhymes for a decoy
Now I'm a Bad Boy, watch the MC's I destroy, and…

Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear

I prayed that he would finish

Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said blah-blah-blah
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said, ""How do you like the show?"" She said, ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man,"" she tried to pretend
She said, ""No I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on
I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing

You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin', getttin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up
A relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again
I say, ""Yo, who was that?"" ""Oh, he's just a friend""
Don't gimme that, don't ever gimme that
Jus' bust this

You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
""Yo, could you tell me where is door three?""
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth
I was so in shock my heart went down south
So please listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend

Attention all ladies
The Candyman is on the prowl
And for those that wanna get busy
You gots to speak up now
(Candyman)
This rhyme, this time
Is one of a kind, blowing yo mind
Like only the Candyman can
Like a heavyweight champion
Knockin'em out, another bout without a doubt
Once again you can scream and shout
When I rock the bells
Yell out my name
This is what you've been missing
Listen to my heart beat, while I'm whispering
I know your suffering
So sweet a Candyman sweet nothings
Hugging and tugging and rubbing
Loving it all, having a ball
All ya'll girlies next to me
Talking sex to me
We can't do that yet, but I bet will chill
(Candyman telling'em the truth)
Will still end up knockin the boots
(Chorus)
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
(Candyman)
At each and every show, thers's this groupie
Artis knows what she wants to do to me
She knows my name, knows every rap routine
But how she get in my limousine
Don't act fool, don't drool
I'm just a performer
I was cool but the room got warmer
Norma cornered me in
Her and a friend named Llynn, then
They checked me in to the Holiday Inn
I didn't let'em win, said my pockets was thin
She blew me a kiss
I knew she wasn't new to this
I didn't want to, but the devil made me do it
To the tic-toc ya don't stop
We knock boots till 6 o'clock, as we lay
All night long
And early in the morning she sang this song
(Chorus)
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too
(Girl I do)
(Candyman)
Tunnel of love is what I'm entering
When I mention it, you're surrending
Giving it up like a good girl has to
Living it up
Eventually you ask to stay
You're gonna pay for this
Just rest your breast on my chest, yes I'm impressed
With the way you cold love me down
I don't wanna sit down, I just wanna get down
I'm on the ground, down on my knees
Like James Brown singing Please, Please
Round two, I'm down to
Do, what it takes to make you
Understand I'm the Candyman
And I melt in your mouth, not in your hands
Hard as rock, yes I'm no sucka
The boots I knock make me one bad mutha
(Unh Unh...giggling) *2
Knockin, while I'm a hip-hoppin
Many people say my lyrics are shocking
Just because of the simple subject
Everyone should love this
Cause everybody does it
Whether they admit it or if they deny it
You betta keep quiet
Or else you might have to see a few skeletons
But girl thats irrevelent
Break out the bottle of Asti Spumante
Pop off the top and rock wit my posse
Fila Al, Big Dill, and D Fly
We ask the questions, you give the reply
MC Chip, Big Rob and Bud
Rockin on the waterbed, knockin on the rugs
I'm just playing, what I'm saying ain't ill
Girl you should know I'm real
(Unh Unh..giggling) *2

All right! Stop whatcha doin', 'cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that ya used to
I look funny—but yo I'm making money, see
So yo world I hope you're ready for me
Now gather round, I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground
I drink up all the Hennessy ya got on ya shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a ""umpty""
Yo ladies, oh how I like to funk thee
And all the rappers in the top ten--please allow me to bump thee
I'm steppin' tall, y'all, and just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky
I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
But sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Hey yo fat girl, c'mere--are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat; look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from getting busy
I'm a freak, I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy, allow me to amaze thee
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me
I'm still getting in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

People say ""Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'""
That's all right cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
But ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B
All the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really being sincere
Cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still getting paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge
Both how I'm living and my nose is large
I get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid
I use a word that don't mean nothing, like looptid
I sang on ""Doowutchalike"", and if ya missed it
I'm the one who said, ""Just grab 'im in the biscuits""
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write
All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
And now I'm gonna do my dance

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Oh, yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here
Oh, yeah!
Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
Let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do--check it out

First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shaking and twitching kinda like I was smoking
Crazy wack funky
People say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty
That's all right cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humping, funking, jumping
Jig around, shaking ya rump
And when a doo-doo chump punk points a finger like a stump
Tell him step off, I'm doing the Hump

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Puerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doing the hump
Samoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Let's get stoopid!

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Oh, yeah, come on and break it down

Once again, the Underground is in the house
I'd like to send a shout out to the whole world
Keep on doing the Humpty Dance
And to the ladies
Peace, and Humptiness forever

Nine-fo' (keep bangin')

To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical douches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mamis?
The back of the club, sippin' Moët is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin', blunt passin'
Music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not?
Why blow up my spot cause we both got hot?
Now check it: I got more mack than Craig, and in the bed
Believe me, sweetie, I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benzes
C-notes by the layers, true fuckin' players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS3, I got the chronic by the tree

I love it when you call me big poppa
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
I love it when you call me big poppa
To the honies getting money
Playing niggas like dummies

Please don't shoot up the place!
‘Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be having my baby, baby

Straight up, honey, really I'm askin'
Most of these niggas think they be mackin', but they be actin'
Who they attractin' with that line
""What's your name? What's your sign?""
Soon as he buy that wine, I just creep up from behind
And ask you what your interests are, who you be with
Things that make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while?
I'm gon' go call my crew, you go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around 2
Plans to leave, throw the keys to Lil Cease
Pull the truck up front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly, go fill my belly
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, ‘cause in a few we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right, boo? (true)
Forget the telly, we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the jacuzzi, smoke L's while you do me

I love it when you call me big poppa
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
I love it when you call me big poppa

(How you living, Biggie Smalls?) In mansions and Benzes
Givin' ends to my friends, and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream: fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams
Choppin' Os, smokin' la in Optimos
Money, hoes and clothes: all a nigga knows
A foolish pleasure? Whatever
I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure
However, living better now, Coogi sweater now
Drop top BM's, I'm the man, girlfriend

Yeah, honey, check it—
Tell your friends to get with my friends
And we can be friends
Shit, we can do this every weekend, aight?

Leavin your face in the grass
Cause you know, I don't take a duro, lightly
Punks just jealous cause they can't outwrite me
Or kick that style, wicked, wild

Rip that mainframe, I'll explain

Head underground to the next town

And I'm out in the nine-deuce Cad'

Hide from the red light beam

I don't know what it is that you've done to me
But it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing
It's a feeling I wanna stay
Time after time after time I try to fight it
But your love is strong and keeps on holding on
Resistance down when you're around pride's fading
My condition I don't wanna be alone
Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
Can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you
Time after time after time I try to fight it
But your love is strong and keeps on holding on
Resistance down when you're around pride's fading
My condition I don't wanna be alone
Cause my heart starts beating triple time
With thoughts of loving you on my mind
Can't figure out just what to do
When the cause and cure is you
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
In a daze it is so amazing it's not a phase
I want you to stay with me by my side
I swallow my pride your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your love it makes me weak
I try hard to fight it
No way can I deny it

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence
""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence

Lovers say that in France
When they thrill to romance
It means that it's so good
C'est si bon
So I say to you
Like the French people do
Because it's oh, so good
Every word, every sigh, every kiss, dear
Leads to only one thought
And the thought is this, dear!
C'est si bon
Nothing else can replace
Just your slyest embrace
And if you only would
Be my own for the rest of my days
I will whisper this phrase
My darling, my darling...

(Verse)
Days can be sunny
With never a sigh
Don't need what money
Can buy
Birds in the trees sing
Their dayful of song
Why shouldn't we sing
Along?
I'm chipper all the day
Happy with my lot
How do I get that way?
Look at what I got
(Chorus)
I got rhythm
I got music
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
I got daisies
In green pastures
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
Old Man Trouble
I don't mind him
You won't find him
'Round my door
I got starlight
I got sweet dreams
I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?

Un jour de différence
Dans toute une existence
Ça n'a pas d'importance
Semble-t-il et pourtant
La vie vous semble grise
24 heures suffisent
Pour qu'on la trouve exquise
Que faut-il simplement
Il faut bien peu
De choses
Le parfum d'une rose
Un sourire qui se pose
Sur vous bien doucement
J'en fais par vous
L'expérience
Et c'est pourquoi
Je pense que
Un jour de différence
C'est quelques fois beaucoup

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence
""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""

If you've ever been lost in a blue note
Then you know how i'm feeling tonight
I'm down to a thin wisp of blue smoke
That curls 'round the cold candle light
If you've ever been chained to a heartache
You're so sure there's no hope in sight
If you've ever been lost in a blue note
Then you know how i'm feeling tonight
Sax man blows and a teardrop flows
Straight from my heart to the floor
The band won't look at me, i know they can see
That he doesn't love me anymore
If you've ever been chained to a heartache
You're so sure there's no hope in sight
If you've ever been lost in a blue note
Then you know how i'm feeling tonight

Yes, it's a good day for singing a song
And it's a good day for moving alone;
Yes, it's a good day, how could anything go wrong
A good day from morning' till night
Yes, it's a good day for shining your shoes
And it's a good day for losing the blues;
Everything go gain and nothing' to lose
'Cause it's a good day from morning' till night
I said to the Sun, ""Good morning sun
Rise and shine today""
You know you've gotta get going
If you're gonna make a showin'
And you know you've got the right of way
'Cause it's a good day for paying your bills;
And it's a good day for curing your ills
So take a deep breath and throw away your pills;
'Cause it's a good day from morning' till night

Getting out of bed late
Sunlight through your hair
Curtis Blaine Fye on the radio
And flowers everywhere
Ooohh
Everything is alright with me
'cause your love is mine
Oooohh
Your love is all mine, yeah
Looking out the window
There's nothing but blue sky
Breakfest sizzling in the kitchen
I see the mistify in your eyes and
Ooooh
Everything is just fine with me
'cause your love is mine
Oooohh
Your love is all mine, yeah
I've got this feeling
That I'll always be alright, yeah
Because you're my desire and
I'm your delight
Your love is all mine
Can we drive to the country
I'll wear my summer dress
Stop the car and walk into the lowergrass
I feel kisses in the back of my neck and
Ooooh
Everything is just fine with me
'cause your love is mine
Oooohh
Your love is all mine, yeah
I've got this feeling
That I'll always be alright, yeah
Because you're my desire and
I'm your delight
